The project was rather rough in terms of peer participation. I tried to urge my peers to get started earlier (I personally began around 10 days beforehand), though progress was really only made during the final two and especially last day for the other two group members. I implemented the vast majority of the Firebase integration which comprised of the majority of the application as well as a healthy majority of the UI and the helpers including fragments and adapters.
Sahom I would say contributed the least. He did the setting activity, the instructions activity, and aided in the development of the UI. Daniel did the card generation and resource gathering for the card class as well as a few layouts and adapters. I did the rest of the activities, the implementation classes of Player and Game, the other two adapters, and around 80% of the fragments and layout files. I would like to note, however, though that Daniel did appear to be very sick and was without a computer for most of the duration of the project. Even given this, we evidently had trouble getting this completed.
